            <h1> About ME!</h1>
            <p> 
                Anna is currently an independent consultant for pampered chef.  She also teaches english to kids in china and is learning how to do computer coiding.  Her favorite job so far is pampered chef but she is hoping to be able to add to her income and skill set with her coding class.  
            </p>
            <p>
                When not working or learning to code you can usually find Anna outside or hanging out inside with good friends and family.  She enjoys warm weather and the beach.  Although she is a Colorado native she is not a huge fan of the snow.  "It is too cold and messy and you can't be barefoot, plus... swimming"  she says.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Anna enjoys the company of her best furry friend Islay.  Islay is a cocker spaniel mix and is a very silly and happy little dog!  She has been living with Anna for over 2 years now allowing Anna to use the cheesy saying "im not sure who adopted who!"
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are in the need for any kitchen supplies be sure to contact Anna and she will happily help you host a fantasitc party where you will have the oportunity to earn all kids of amazing rewards, even free products!
